# Medscheduler

**Medscheduler** is a Python library for generating synthetic outpatient scheduling datasets.  
It creates realistic but fully synthetic data for teaching, dashboards, prototyping, and research, without privacy concerns.

The library simulates three main components:

- **Slots**: configurable appointment calendars (days, hours, and density).  
- **Patients**: synthetic registry with realistic ageâ€“sex distribution.  
- **Appointments**: the main table linking slots and patients with attendance outcomes.

Outputs are returned as pandas DataFrames, with optional CSV export.

## Key features

- Synthetic scheduling pipeline: slots, patients, and appointments.  
- Configurable: working days, hours, slot density, attendance rates, cancellations, rebooking.  
- Safe for sharing: fully synthetic, no real patient data.  
- Analytics ready: integration with pandas and visualization helpers.
