# Examples

The **Examples** section provides interactive notebooks that demonstrate how to configure, generate, and analyze synthetic outpatient scheduling scenarios using Medscheduler.  
Each notebook highlights a distinct aspect of the simulation — from time windows and seasonality to patient flow, attendance, and custom attributes — allowing users to explore realistic variations step by step.

Use these examples as practical complements to the **User Guide** and **API Reference** to understand how parameter choices translate into observable scheduling behaviors.
